PSEUDO COLUMN 
   Pseudo columns are the false column that are present in each and every table and must be called explicitly.
 
Pseudo columns cannot be seen without calling them.
   We have 2 types:
     1). ROWID
     2). ROWNUM

1). ROWID
	ROWID IS AN 18 DIGIT ADDRESS IN WHICH THE RECORD IS PRESENT (OR) THE RECORD IS STORED IN THE MEMORY (VIRTUAL MEMEORY).


 Note:
 	1. ROWID is one of the way to access or delete the record 
 	2. ROWID is unique.
 	3. ROWID is present for each and every record .
 	4. ROWID is generated at the time of insertion of records.
 	5. ROWID cannot be inserted, updated or deleted .
 	6. Empty table will not be having ROWID
 	7. ROWID is static in nature .
 	8. ROWID can be used to identify a record uniquely from the table when there is no key attribute or primary key

	SYNTAX:

 		1. TO FETCH TOP RECORD  
		SELECT */COLUMN_NAME/EXPRESSION
 		FROM EMP E1
 		WHERE ( SELECT COUNT([ DISTINCT] ROWID ) 
		FROM EMP E2
		WHERE E1.ROWID >= E2.ROWID) = N ;


 		2.TO FETCH BOTTOM RECORD
 		SELECT */COLUMN_NAME/EXPRESSION
 		FROM EMP E1
 		WHERE ( SELECT COUNT([ DISTINCT] ROWID ) 
		FROM EMP E2
 		WHERE E1.ROWID< =E2.ROWID) = N ;


	EXAMPLE:
 		SELECT ROWID,EMP.*
                FROM EMP;

ASSIGNMENT ON ROWID:

	1). WAQTD FETCH THE FIRST RECORD FROM THE EMP TABLE
    	ANS :   select *
            	from emp e1
            	where (select count(ROWID) from emp e2
            	where e1.ROWID >= e2.ROWID) = 1 ;

	2). WAQTD FETCH THE 2ND  RECORD FROM THE EMP TABLE
   	ANS:    select *
            	from emp e1
            	where (select count(ROWID) from emp e2
            	where e1.ROWID >= e2.ROWID) = 2 ;

	3). WAQTD FETCH THE 4TH,5TH,8TH RECORD FROM THE EMP TABLE
    	ANS:    select *
            	from emp e1
            	where (select count(ROWID) from emp e2
            	where e1.ROWID >= e2.ROWID) IN (4,5,8) ;   

	4). WAQTD FETCH THE LAST  RECORD FROM THE EMP TABLE
    	ANS:    select *
            	from emp e1
            	where (select count(ROWID) from emp e2
            	where e1.ROWID <= e2.ROWID) = 1 ; 

	5). WAQTD FETCH THE SECOND LAST RECORD FROM THE EMP TABLE
    	ANS:    select *
            	from emp e1
            	where (select count(ROWID) from emp e2
            	where e1.ROWID <= e2.ROWID) = 2 ;


2). ROWNUM
 	ROWNUM acts as serial number to the result table.

 Note:
 	1.ROWNUM is used as record number that is assigned to the result table
 	2.ROWNUM is dynamic in nature.
 	3.ROWNUM is generated at the time of execution.
 	4.ROWNUM always starts with 1.
 	5.ROWNUM cannot be duplicated .
 	6.ROWNUM get incremented after it is assigned .

 	
	Example:
 	  1. WAQTD ROWNUM ALONG WITH ALL THE DETAILS OF EMP.
 	  ANS:	SELECT ROWNUM, EMP.*
 		FROM EMP;
         
          2. WAQTD FIRST  3 RECORDS.
          ANS:  SELECT *
                FROM EMP
                WHERE ROWNUM<4;



TO MAKE ROWNUM AS STATIC:
 	1). Take a table and assign ROWNUM to a given table
        2). Change the ROWNUM to any other name by using ALIAS 
 	3). Use this as a subquery in form clause of outer query
 	4). In the outer query use the alias name in the condition



	Example:
            1). WAQTD  THIRD 3 RECORD
            ANS:  SELECT *
 		  FROM (SELECT ROWNUM SLNO,EMP.*
 		  FROM EMP)
 		  WHERE SLNO=3 ;



ASSIGNMENT ON ROWNUM:
	
	1).  WAQTD THE FETCH FIRST RECORD FROM THE EMP TABLE.
        ANS:   SELECT *
               FROM (SELECT  ROWNUM  SLNO ,EMP.* FROM EMP) 
               WHERE SLNO = 1 ;
    
        2).  WAQTD THE FETCH 2ND AND 3RD RECORD FROM THE EMP TABLE.
        ANS:   SELECT *
               FROM (SELECT  ROWNUM  SLNO ,EMP.* FROM EMP) 
               WHERE SLNO IN (2,3) ;
       
        3).  WAQTD THE FETCH  7TH RECORD FROM THE EMP TABLE.
        ANS:   SELECT *
               FROM (SELECT  ROWNUM  SLNO ,EMP.* FROM EMP) 
               WHERE SLNO = 7 ;

        4).  WAQTD THE FETCH FIRST FIVE RECORDS FROM THE EMP TABLE. 
        ANS:   SELECT *
               FROM (SELECT  ROWNUM  SLNO ,EMP.* FROM EMP) 
               WHERE SLNO <=5 ;

        5).  WAQTD THE FETCH FIRST SEVEN RECORDS FROM THE EMP TABLE.
        ANS:   SELECT *
               FROM (SELECT  ROWNUM  SLNO ,EMP.* FROM EMP) 
               WHERE SLNO <=7 ;
